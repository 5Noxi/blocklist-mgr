# Blocklist Manager

The hosts file is a local DNS override used to block domains or redirect websites. (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`) A filter get's added via e.g. uBO - filter within the browser -> no system wide blocking.

Examples:
```
0.0.0.0 ads.com -> non routable address
127.0.0.1 ads.com -> loopback address

||ads.com^ -> filter (browser)
@@||ads.com^ -> exception
```
First numbers (IP address) is where the domain will be **directed to**, the second (domain name) is the site, which is getting **redirected** (blocked). 

1. [`0.0.0.0`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.0.0.0) **blocks/drops** the request instantly - making them "unreachable" (known as being faster than `127.0.01`, but may be incompatible on some systems)
2. [`127.0.0.1`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/localhost) redirects the domain to the **localhost** (your computer) - called "*loopback address*"
3. [`||ads.com^`](https://adblockplus.org/filter-cheatsheet?DE_EXCEPTION=1) blocks the domain - wouldn't block `http://domain.com/redirect/http://ads.com/` -> can't be used within the hosts file

You should never use all blocklists! This would break most of your applications & slow down your system by a lot. Applying all lists won't give you a better browsing experience! Try to use at least lists as possible. (or use the default preset) Using big lists system wide (hosts file) is also not recommended - if you're planning to use a big list, do that via e.g. uBO (even if the list is compatible with the hosts file). Importing a list will override your current hosts!

[`Hosts File Editor`](https://github.com/5Noxi/windows-dev-docs/blob/docs/hub/powertoys/hosts-file-editor.md) (PowerToys) can be used for editing, adding, removing, and managing hosts file entries. It's not compatible with the entries `Blocklist-Manager.ps1` makes, as it compresses the entries, e.g.:
```ps
# Default formatting
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io

# Compressed
0.0.0.0 5noxi.github.io 5noxi.github.io 5noxi.github.io 5noxi.github.io 5noxi.github.io 5noxi.github.io 5noxi.github.io 5noxi.github.io 5noxi.github.io 5noxi.github.io
```
It's included in PowerToys (`winget install Microsoft.PowerToys`), but doesn't need to be installed if you use `Blocklist-Manager.ps1`, unless you want to manage single entries (which is buggy anyway). I'll probably add my own editor soon that correctly handles compressed host entries.

## Issues after importing multiple lists?

Open `cmd` and paste `del /f /q C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` into it. If it shows that the DNS client used it, flush your DNS (`ipconfig /flushdns`). Still not? Boot into safemode (`bcdedit /set safeboot minimal`) & remove the hosts file. This may be needed, if importing too many lists.

Default `hosts` content:
```ps
# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#    127.0.0.1       localhost
#    ::1             localhost
```

## GUI Buttons
The presets are just examples, use lists from the vendor you prefer.

## Additional features:
- Click on the category name (blue) to open the source link
- Adjust the window size, to increase the size of the hosts/log box
- `hosts` preview refreshes itself automatically
- You can edit the hosts file via the panel in the GUI (doesn't create a backup)
